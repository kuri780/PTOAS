# Directory runner for the A5 TileLib operator-level ST cases.
#
# Each operator suite (e.g. tadd, tmatmul, ...) is a subdirectory with a
# ``case.py`` module that authors its kernels with PTODSL and builds its CASES
# list through the helpers in the parent ``test/tilelib-st/common.py`` module.
# Running this directory discovers every nested ``case.py`` module and executes
# the cases against the torch_npu / simulator runtime.
#
# See test/tilelib-st/README.md for the authoring conventions.
